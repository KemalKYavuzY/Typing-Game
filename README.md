## Typing Game

Welcome to the Typing Game in C repository! This project is a simple typing game implemented in the C programming language. Players are challenged to type words as they appear on the screen before they reach the bottom.

## Features:
- Dynamic word generation: Words appear randomly on the screen for the player to type.
- User input handling: Players can input their typed words to match those displayed on the screen.
- Basic gameplay mechanics: The game tracks the player's score based on the number of correctly typed words and ends when a word reaches the bottom of the screen.

## Getting Started:
  To play the game, follow these steps:
  - Clone the repository to your local machine.
  - Compile the FinalProject.c file using a C compiler (e.g., GCC).
    
    gcc -o FinalProject FinalProject.c -lncurses


  - Run the compiled executable.
    
    ./FinalProject wordList.txt


## Gameplay Instructions:
- After launching the game, a random word will appear on the screen every second.
- Type the word as quickly and accurately as possible before it reaches the bottom.
- Score points for each correctly typed word.
- The game ends if a word reaches the bottom of the screen.
